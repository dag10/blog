I just won a free trip to the Google Headquarters. How did I do it?

For the last three years, Google has run an international programming
competition,
[Google Code-In](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2012/about_page),
for pre-university students between the ages of 13 and 17. There are ten
open-source software organizations that take part and create sets of
programming [tasks](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gci/tasks/google/gci2012),
usually requiring the student to write a small amount of code. After
completing one task, students earn a certificate that will be mailed to them.
After completing three tasks, students win a Google t-shirt.

What’s most interesting, however, is the grand prize. Each of the ten
organizations name two students as grand prize winners, making a total of
twenty winners. A winner receives a four-night all-expenses-paid trip to
Google’s headquarters (a.k.a. The
[Googleplex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex)) in Mountain View,
California. The winners get to speak with Google engineers, tour Google, visit
San Francisco, and receive additional prizes (swag); last year’s winners each
received a Galaxy Nexus smart phone!

When I discovered this competition on December 1st — a few days after it began
— I thought “well this would be a fun way to win a free t-shirt!” And so I
began contributing code to a game called [Hedgewars](http://hedgewars.org),
completing tasks. Within a few days, I earned my shirt, but I didn’t feel like
stopping. I didn’t even have the grand prize in mind; I was making significant
[contributions](http://hedgewars.org/node/4612) to the game and its main
developers were loving my work. It was too rewarding to stop.

24 hours before the contest ended, I decided to re-read the rules of the
competition. In doing so, I discovered that only the top-five students within
each organization are considered for the grand prize — of which two will win.

I was in 6th place.

The most intense all-nighter of my life happened on the morning of January
14th, 2013. Yep, that’s a Monday. I may have called in sick to school.
Adrenaline flowing, I completed more tasks in the last 24 hours of the
competition than I have in the first seven weeks. Arc Riley, the head of the
organization,
[took notice](https://plus.google.com/109741359399131092509/posts/XaryX4jXEdk).

I made 5th place, and felt fantastic. Perhaps partly due to the residual
adrenaline. I was satisfied that I
[made it as a finalist](https://plus.google.com/109741359399131092509/posts/3WxBzWjbF6W),
because otherwise I would have automatically lost any chance of winning the
grand prize, and all of my work would have been for nothing. Well, not
nothing, but you know what I mean.

I participated in this competition just to win a t-shirt, and ended up a
finalist, which by itself is good enough for me. But then
